# Reconstruction-of-censored-trajectories
We consider particles trajectories following birth and death processes as well as Browian motion with drift. 
These trajectories are observed on a subregion of the region where they lay over. We aim recognizing if some of tracklets (censored tracks) could be 
connected through the unobserved region.
